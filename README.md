# Ruptured AAA Audit

## Methods

### Inpatient Data
The national inpatients dataset held by PHS (known as SMR01) will be searched for any males, of age 65 and older, who have presented with a ruptured aneurysm (ICD10 codes I71.3, I71.5, and I71.8), in order to remove elective surgeries from the search. Records are omitted if the aneurysm is listed as either the 4th or 5th conditions. *Date of death is taken from AAA extract.

### Mortality Data
National Records of Scotland (NRS) death records will be searched for any males who have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, with or without rupture (ICD10 codes I71.3, I71.4, I71.5, I71.6, I71.8, and I71.9), listed in any position on their death certificate. Individuals aged older than 65 on 1 January 2012 are to be excluded as they would not have been part of the AAA screening programme. The remaining records are then matched to patient AAA records to identify date of vascular surgery in order to identify if the individual died within 30 days of their surgery. *Date of death is taken from the NRS death records and is supplemented by the AAA extract, where needed and possible.

CHI number will be used to link all datasets, keeping only one record per patient. In order to help screening units review data, the search will be carried out for hospital admissions and/or deaths following the calendar year (January - December).
